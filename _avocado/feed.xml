&lt;p&gt;Avocado is a bootstrap based, clean, minimal Jekyll theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#buy-avocado-jekyll-theme&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-success&quot;&gt;Buy &lt;strike&gt;$25&lt;/strike&gt; $19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is suitable for personal, blog, portfolio or a company website. The highlight of this theme is the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bootsrap-4-based&quot;&gt;Bootsrap 4 Based&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avocado is built on the latest Bootstrap 4 Framework. The theme can be easily customized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addictive-typography&quot;&gt;Addictive typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have selected fonts that go with the design and highly legible. The focus is on the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/avocado-theme.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avocado minimal responsive jekyll theme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/avocado-jekyll-theme-screenshot-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avocado minimal responsive jekyll theme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsive-videos&quot;&gt;Responsive videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just add a class to your video iframe to make it responsive. For example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;video&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; class to any iframe makes it responsive in Avocado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4?start=53&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;paginated-posts&quot;&gt;Paginated posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 4 posts are shown in one page. Older posts are paginated. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;. You can change the number of posts in configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
paginate: 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;automatic-breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;Automatic Breadcrumbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breadcrumbs are generated for every page and post automatically. The default one looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;breadcrumbs rev&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	
	
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	
	
	
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Avocado theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	
	
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color changes with the color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auto-generated-toc&quot;&gt;Auto generated TOC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of contents is automatically generated for each post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-comments&quot;&gt;Get comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus comments is pre-installed. Just sign-up, get a shortname and update the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;disqus&lt;/code&gt; in the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not mention the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;disqus:&lt;/code&gt; value in configuration then the disqus comments code will not be included in the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;track-visitors&quot;&gt;Track visitors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website uses Google Analytics for tracking visitors. Use your own UA code in the configuration. Analytics code will not be used in the website if you do not mention UA code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instant-search&quot;&gt;Instant search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/search/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; anything from your articles in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auto-generated-feed-and-sitemap&quot;&gt;Auto generated feed and sitemap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have given much importance to SEO and made sure you have the &lt;a href=&quot;/sitemap.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/a&gt; ready to submit to search engines. A well formatted &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is readily available for RSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mathjax-support&quot;&gt;MathJax Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now render beautiful math formulas by enabling MathJax in the configuration (enabled by default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subtle-animations&quot;&gt;Subtle animations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scrolling through the page, you may observe some important elements fade in slowly. These elements will attract user attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fully-responsive&quot;&gt;Fully responsive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a pleasure reading content on avocado through a smartphone. Try it to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clean-code&quot;&gt;Clean code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website is w3c compliant. We have tried to keep it without any errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chartjs-support&quot;&gt;Chart.js Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use amazing charts using Chart.js. Enable Chart.js in the configuration(enabled by default)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;canvas id=&quot;myChart&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var ctx = document.getElementById(&quot;myChart&quot;);
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: [&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Purple&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;],
        datasets: [{

            backgroundColor: [

                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
            ],
            borderColor: [

                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    beginAtZero:true
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-simple-stuff&quot;&gt;Other simple stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have given special importance in designing things like reading time, tags, share buttons, recent articles etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;style-guide&quot;&gt;Style Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the headlines will look like on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is a H1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is a H2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is a H3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;This is H4, H5 and H6&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is H4, H5 and H6&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are sample paragraphs showing &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; text style. Fonts are carefully choosen for longer user retention. The text is optimized for legibility. Viewers will get a good experience reading through the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an unordered  list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and an ordered list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Primary&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-warning&quot;&gt;Warning&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Danger&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;Blockquote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an important sentence from the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With multiple lines!&lt;/p&gt;

A professional photographer is likely to take photographs to make money, by salary or through the display, sale or use of those photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amateur photographer may take photographs for pleasure and to record an event, emotion, place, as a person without a monetary motivation. A professional photographer may be an employee, for example of a newspaper, or may contract to cover a particular planned event such as a wedding or graduation, or to illustrate an advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selling-photographs&quot;&gt;Selling photographs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exclusive right of photographers to copy and use their products is protected by copyright. Countless industries purchase photographs for use in publications and on products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photographs seen on magazine covers, in television advertising, on greeting cards or calendars, on websites, or on products and packages, have generally been purchased for this use, either directly from the photographer or through an agency that represents the photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hipster-865295_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Best Jekyll Theme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photographer uses a contract to sell the “license” or use of his or her photograph with exact controls regarding how often the photograph will be used, in what territory it will be used (for example U.S. or U.K. or other), and exactly for which products.&lt;/p&gt;

A professional photographer is likely to take photographs to make money, by salary or through the display, sale or use of those photographs. An amateur photographer may take photographs for pleasure and to record an event, emotion, place, as a person without a monetary motivation. A professional photographer may be an employee, for example of a newspaper, or may contract to cover a particular planned event such as a wedding or graduation, or to illustrate an advertisement. Learn more about this theme Selling photographs The exclusive right of photographers to copy and use their products is protected by copyright. Countless industries purchase photographs for use in publications and on products. The photographs seen on magazine covers, in television advertising, on greeting cards or calendars, on websites, or on products and packages, have generally been purchased for this use, either directly from the photographer or through an agency that represents the photographer. A photographer uses a contract to sell the “license” or use of his or her photograph with exact controls regarding how often the photograph will be used, in what territory it will be used (for example U.S. or U.K. or other), and exactly for which products. This is usually referred to as usage fee and is used to distinguish from production fees (payment for the actual creation of a photograph or photographs). An additional contract and royalty would apply for each additional use of the photograph. Photo sharing Many people upload their photographs to social networking websites and other websites, in order to share them with a particular group or with the general public.

It takes both its common and its scientific name from its bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for “little bell”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest diversity in the Mediterranean region east to the Caucasus. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;Learn more about this theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaves are alternate and often vary in shape on a single plant, with larger, broader leaves at the base of the stem and smaller, narrower leaves higher up; the leaf margin may be either entire or serrated (sometimes both on the same plant). Many species contain white latex in the leaves and stems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some species have a small additional leaf-like growth termed an “appendage” between each sepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flowers are produced in panicles (sometimes solitary), and have a five-lobed corolla, typically large (2–5 cm or more long), mostly blue to purple, sometimes white or pink. Below the corolla, 5 leaf-like sepals form the calyx. Some species have a small additional leaf-like growth termed an “appendage” between each sepal, and the presence or absence, relative size, and attitude of the appendage is often used to distinguish between closely related species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campanula species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Common Pug (recorded on Harebell), Dot Moth, Ingrailed Clay (recorded on Harebell), Lime-speck Pug and Mouse Moth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cultivation-and-uses&quot;&gt;Cultivation and uses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known species include the northern temperate Campanula rotundifolia, commonly known as harebell in England and bluebell in Scotland and Ireland (though it is not closely related to the true bluebells), and the southern European Campanula medium, commonly known as Canterbury bells (a popular garden plant in the United Kingdom). As well as several species occurring naturally in the wild in northern Europe, there are many cultivated garden species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultivars &lt;strong&gt;Burghaltii&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kent Belle&lt;/strong&gt; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The species Campanula rapunculus, commonly known as rampion bellflower, rampion, or rover bellflower, is a biennial vegetable which was once widely grown in Europe for its spinach-like leaves and radish-like roots. The Brothers Grimm’s tale Rapunzel took its name from this plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK the National Collection of campanulas is held at Burton Agnes Hall in East Yorkshire and the National Collection of Alpine Campanulas at Langham Hall in Suffolk.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and Rāja yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda,[note 1] but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India’s ascetic and śramaṇa movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;Learn more about this theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/meditation-2717462_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Best Jekyll Theme&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sanskrit, the word yoga comes from the root yuj which means “to add”, “to join”, “to unite”, or “to attach” in its most common senses. By figurative extension from the yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses, the word took on broader meanings such as “employment, use, application, performance” (compare the figurative uses of “to harness” as in “to put something to some use”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All further developments of the sense of this word are post-Vedic. More prosaic moods such as “exertion”, “endeavour”, “zeal”, and “diligence” are also found in Indian epic poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha (liberation), although the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jacobsen, “Yoga has five principal meanings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga, as a disciplined method for attaining a goal;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga, as techniques of controlling the body and the mind;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga, as a name of one of the schools or systems of philosophy (darśana);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga, in connection with other words, such as “hatha-, mantra-, and laya-,” referring to traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga, as the goal of Yoga practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is bounded by Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming its Western coast. It is India’s smallest state by area and the fourth smallest by population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, that is two and a half times that of the country. It was ranked the best placed state by the “Eleventh Finance Commission” for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock art engravings found in Goa exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India.[8] Goa, situated within the Shimoga-Goa Greenstone Belt in the Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and ferruginous quartzite), yields evidence for Acheulean occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flora-and-fauna&quot;&gt;Flora and fauna&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equatorial forest cover in Goa stands at 1,424 km2 (549.81 sq mi), most of which is owned by the government. Government owned forest is estimated at 1,224.38 km2 (472.74 sq mi) whilst private is given as 200 km2 (77.22 sq mi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the forests in the state are located in the interior eastern regions of the state. The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. In the February 1999 issue of National Geographic Magazine, Goa was compared with the Amazon and the Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tourism&quot;&gt;Tourism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. In 2010, there were more than two million tourists reported to have visited Goa, about 1.2 million of whom were from abroad. As of 2013 Goa was a destination of choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons and Russians, with limited means who wanted to party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state was hopeful that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic. Goa also stands 6th in the Top 10 Nightlife cities in the world in a National Geographic Book. One of the biggest tourist attractions in Goa is water sports. Beaches like Baga and Calangute offer jet-skiing, parasailing, banana boat rides, water scooter rides and more.&lt;/p&gt;
