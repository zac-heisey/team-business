**The Continous Improvement Simulation (CIS)** puts participants in an immersive and competitive environment that gives them a front-row seat to the stresses and complexities of running and operating a business.

CIS focuses competing teams on the following **key drivers of profitability**: **Staff, Time, Resources, Information, and Processes** (STRIP). Teams make high-level strategy decisions on their main business focus: **Quality** (with price being an element of quality), **Volume** (increasing) or **Cost** (decreasing). Based on how their team is able to perform and deliver business results, they evaluate their performance against the STRIP indicators and continuously improve through analysis and modification.

### **THE SIMULATION PROCESS**

As employees of a car manufacturing division, teams are challenged with achieving targets set by management.  Competing teams, fight to ensure they are not the least profitable division, which will be forced to close down.

## No One Gets to Hide in a Team Business Workshop

When participants are under pressure to perform and make good business decisions, they are very energized and have a great deal of fun in the process. This making the learning experience that much more memorable and therefore, that much more valuable to the individuals and your company.

### SIMULATION KEY LEARNINGS

Participants gain an understanding of how to identify opportunities for improvement within the business with a direct impact on profitability. They gain a dramatic appreciation for the relationship between quality, volume, and cost inside a classic business operational structure.

* Business drivers: quality, volume and cost
* How changing these drivers affects profitability
* Benchmarking
* Understanding of critical business drivers: staff, time, resources, information and processes and the how-to manage constraints
* How these drivers can be used to identify shortcomings and opportunities for improvement within a business

### APPLICATION BACK TO THE BUSINESS

Having completed the simulation, participants are able to translate the learning to the challenges faced by your business.  They will have a keen ability to identify and define shortcoming and opportunities within the business.

**Staff will be able to:**

* Pinpoint which key business drivers, if focused upon, is likely to produce the greatest increase in profitability
* identify which inputs they are to acquire more of, or use better, that will produce the most value in pursuit of improvement objectives regarding Quality, Volume or Cost
* Better understand the impact that input behaviour and performance have on the bottom-line

### PROGRAM SIZE

Teams typically have 7-10 members each, and a workshop can be up to 120 people. Participants of all disciplines can participate. The program can be run in 4 hours in a single session.
