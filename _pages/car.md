CAR puts participants in an immersive and competitive environment that gives them a front-row seat to the stresses and complexities of running & operating a business.

By thinking hard about the critical business inputs of staff, time, resources, information, and processes, participants gain an understanding of how to identify opportunities for improvement within the business. They gain a dramatic appreciation for the relationship between quality, volume, and cost inside a classic business operational structure.
