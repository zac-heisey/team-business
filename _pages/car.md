CAR puts participants in an immersive and competitive environment that gives them a front-row seat to the stresses and complexities of running & operating a business.

By thinking hard about the critical business inputs of staff, time, resources, information, and processes, participants gain an understanding of how to identify opportunities for improvement within the business. They gain a dramatic appreciation for the relationship between quality, volume, and cost inside a classic business operational structure.

## No One Gets to Hide in a Team Business Workshop

Participants will inevitably discover things about their behavior under stress and their innate abilities, all cultivated in a safe and supportive learning environment. Participants will have an intense--yet fun--experience whose impact goes beyond just learning, and into self discovery. Students come away with many important experiences.

**Key Learnings:**

* Business drivers: quality, volume and cost
* How changing these drivers affects profitability
* Benchmarking
* Understanding of critical business drivers: staff, time, resources, information and processes and the how to manage constraints
* How these drivers can be used to identify shortcomings and opportunities for improvement within a business

Teams typically have 7-10 members each, and a workshop can be up to 120 people. Participants of all disciplines can participate. The program can be run in 4 hours in a single session.
