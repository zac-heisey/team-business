<p style="font-size: 24px;">Your employees learn about your business, its challenges and opportunities, and how they, as individuals or leaders can make your business more successful.</p>

<ol style="font-size: 20px;">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your organization’s vision is reiterated</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants analyze their function as if it were a business</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify their key internal suppliers and customers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine their key value drivers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze how to maximize these drivers</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a plan of action, including milestones and measurements</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, they take the plans back to the workplace and implement and track them</span></li>
</ol>
Employees take the lessons from the simulation and, guided by the facilitator, apply them to their own value-adding roles in the organization:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to contribute to, and the willingness to embrace change</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shared language with management to facilitate business-like communications</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team-based approach to solving problems, making decisions and adding value</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A practical understanding of how business (and in particular their own organization) works</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding of core business principles; how/where value is created and destroyed</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifies all stakeholders – their contributions and their share in the organization</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How each individual can impact identified value drivers</span></li>
 	<li>How to utilize business theories as tools, to help structure their business decision making</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Participants will inevitably discover things about their behavior under stress and their innate abilities, all cultivated in a safe and supportive learning environment. Participants will have an intense--yet fun--experience whose impact goes beyond just learning, and into self discovery.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Teams typically have 4-8 members each, and a workshop can be up to 30 people. Ideal for either cross-functional, multi-level, “in tact” teams or leadership teams. The program can be run in 1 full day or 2 half-day sessions.</p>
