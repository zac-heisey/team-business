OUR BUSINESS IS SEEING YOUR STUDENTS BECOME LEADERS<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">ENRICH YOUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING WITH HANDS-ON,
INTERACTIVE, LEARNING EXPERIENCES</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">vThe <strong>TEAM workshop</strong> teaches teamwork and leadership skills. Business competition among the teams is structured to be particularly intense and dynamic, allowing behaviors to rise to the surface and teams to observe behaviors under stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Participants learn not only about the importance of teamwork and communication, but also their own strengths and limitations in intense situations. The emotional power of these interactions has a powerful and lasting effect and is for many, a road to increased self awareness and self confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Key Learnings:</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">A view into the participant's individual behavior under stress</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Interesting insight into the power or weakness of collective decision making</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">A sound understanding of the decision making and thinking processes of their team members</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">The experience breaks down barriers and encourages cooperation beyond the workshop</li>
</ul>
