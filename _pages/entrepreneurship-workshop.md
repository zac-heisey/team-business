<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Why run the BOX + Workshop?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Employees take the lessons from the entrepreneurship workshop and, guided by the facilitator, apply them to their own value-adding roles in the organization. They learn how to view the business holistically and not just from their department or individual vantage point. They learn the language of business and gain skills that result in decisions with bottom-line impact. Here is how to benefit from BOX + :</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Your organization’s vision is reiterated</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Participants analyze their individual function as if it were a business</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">They identify their key internal suppliers and customers, their inputs and processes</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">They determine their key value drivers, analyze how to maximize these and how to overcome constraints, develop a plan of action, including milestones and measurements</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Before leaving the workshop, participants make business improvement recommendations using the business skills, language and logic gained throughout the workshop</li>
