The BOX workshop uses a hands-on, experiential simulation as a tool to improve your people's business decision making, whether they are staff or students! Participants start and run a box-making business for several 'imaginary' months and are placed under pressure to perform and beat the competition by making more profit. Through the experience, they play the role of managers (financial, production, HR), and workers and during the simulation interact with suppliers and customers.  In many cases, they need to accomplish their objective or task by influencing others. We create a fun, yet pressure-filled environment, in which great learning occurs - business and behavioural.

### **THE SIMULATION PROCESS**

Everyone is challenged to participate in the fun and competitive production and management of a product. Starting with a kickoff meeting, roles and processes are established. Participants are presented with the management of a number of concepts and activities.

## No One Gets to Hide in a Team Business Workshop

Everyone is challenged to participate in the fun and competitive production and management of a product. Starting with a kickoff meeting, roles and processes are established. Participants are presented with the management of a number of concepts and activities.

### SIMULATION KEY LEARNINGS

* The importance of understanding the customer and their needs (internal and external)
* The importance of using this understanding to influence your vendors or internal suppliers
* How to adapt in a continuously changing environment
* How to troubleshoot and think creatively
* How to influence others
* How the engagement of the entire team is needed to achieve stronger business results
* How to think of the whole business and not just your silo

### APPLICATION BACK TO THE BUSINESS

All the learning can then be applied to real challenges in the business, using the value-chain as the foundation for making business changes with bottom-line impact.

### PROGRAM SIZE

Teams typically have 4-5 members each, and a workshop is ideally between 16-30 people. Participants of all disciplines can participate.
