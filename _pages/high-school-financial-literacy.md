OUR BUSINESS IS SEEING YOUR STUDENTS EXCEL<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">ENRICH YOUR CURRICULUM WITH HANDS-ON,
INTERACTIVE, LEARNING EXPERIENCES</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">Understanding accounting IS understanding business.  Our financial literacy program for high school students uses color, visual and tactile techniques to teach financial literacy.  Too many financial literacy programs for teens use the lecture or transfer method of teaching to teach accounting.  <strong>Accounting Comes Alive</strong> is an accelerated financial training program that is interactive, hands-on and uses scenario based methods to teach accounting.  Complete financial literacy training with real life business scenarios. Group simulations and experienced based training make the curriculum real!  Add this program to an existing course, implement it as a special activity at school, partner with a local business or add it to a summer program.  Half or full day programs available.</p>
