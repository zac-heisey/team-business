## Team Business offers business education programs in the form of hands-onÂ simulations that are designed to teach through experience.

The Team Business experiences use basic financial tools to plan production activities, resource requirements, measure performance and benchmark against the competition. Participants get to observe the outcome of their business decisions, acquiring an understanding of the relationship between decisions made and outcomes realized.

We believe in learning through doing, so we create a safe environment to make mistakes and ask questions. All of the Team Business simulations and programs are designed with the principles of peer feedback, team-building, competition, and communication. Each program is facilitated by an expert certified instructor. Team Business is able to accommodate all levels of learning, from interns to C-suite executives.
