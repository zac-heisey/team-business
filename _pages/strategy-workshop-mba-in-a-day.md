<p style="text-align: left;">Over a series of five business cycles, they are presented with a range of strategic challenges, taught the relevant business theory and required to make business decisions, using the theories provided. Working in teams, they face the challenges, make decisions, implement them, see the results, and reflect on their performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Part Two:  The Application to your Company </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Part two is designed to ensure that learning translates into bottom-line impact for your business. It enables participants to now use the theories and decision-making processes they have acquired in relation to their individual work situations.</p>
