TEACH TEAMWORK THROUGH FAST PACED, DYNAMIC COMPETITION<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">CORPORATE TEAM BUILDING </span>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>TEAM+ workshop</strong> is team building training which creates bonds in a group that last beyond the workshop.  Participants learn not only about the importance of teamwork and communication, but also their own strengths and limitations in intense situations. The emotional power of these interactions has a powerful and lasting effect and is for many, a road to increased self-awareness and self- confidence while improving team dynamics in the workplace. Group simulations and experience based training makes curriculum real. Contact us now!</p>
