OUR BUSINESS IS SEEING YOUR EMPLOYEES EXCEL<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">GIVE STAFF THE TOOLS TO MAKE DECISIONS </span>

<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">WITH BOTTOM-LINE IMPACT</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">The BOX+<strong> entrepreneurship workshop </strong>is designed to accelerate business learning and team bonding–enabling better business decisions to be made.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In BOX+, participants are lead through an imaginary 4-6 months in the development of a new business. Your employees learn what it means to start, run and build a business!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Employees take the lessons from BOX+ and apply them to their own value-adding roles in the organization.  They learn how to view the business holistically and not just from their department or individual vantage point. They learn the language of business and gain skills that result in decisions with bottom-line impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our entrepreneurship program using group simulations and experience based training makes the curriculum real! Contact us now!</p>
