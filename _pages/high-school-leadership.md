OUR BUSINESS IS SEEING YOUR STUDENTS BECOME LEADERS<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">ENRICH YOUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING WITH HANDS-ON,
INTERACTIVE, LEARNING EXPERIENCES</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>TEAM workshop</strong> id an accelerated leadership program for high school students teaching teamwork and leadership skills. Business competition among the teams is structured to be particularly intense and dynamic, allowing behaviors to rise to the surface and teams to observe behaviors under stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through hands-on group based experiences, students learn not only about the importance of teamwork and communication, but also their own strengths and limitations in intense situations. The emotional power of these interactions has a powerful and lasting effect and is for many, a road to increased self awareness and self confidence.  Leadership activities for high school students using group simulations and experienced based training makes the curriculum real!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Add this program to an existing course, implement it as a special activity at school, partner with a local business or add it to a summer program.  Half or full day programs available.  Contact us to learn more about this highly effective youth leadership program for high school students.</p>
