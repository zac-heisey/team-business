TEAM DYNAMICS AND TEAM BUILDING WORKSHOPTEAMWORK, LEADERSHIP, SELF-AWARENESS<span style="color: #fff;">The TEAM and TEAM + are team building workshops. These workshops expose participants to how team dynamics in the workplace strongly impact business relationships and performance. They can be run in a full or half day experiential learning workshop.</span>JTNDaHIlMjBzdHlsZSUzRCUyMndpZHRoJTNBJTIwMjUlMjUlM0IlMjBib3JkZXItY29sb3IlM0ElMjAlMjMwMGM4ZDclM0IlMjIlM0U=
<p style="text-align: left;">The TEAM and TEAM + programs, place participants under extreme time and challenge pressures to create an environment for behavioral observation under stress.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">In this “safe” learning environment, peoples’ true personalities are exposed and they learn how to enhance their strengths and work on their weaknesses, in a non-threatening environment. This creates a great environment for behaviors to be observed and a platform for leadership coaching.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why run the TEAM Building Workshop in the Education Environment?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Educational institutions usually use TEAM at the beginning of a course, which brings people together, who did not previously know one another. The extreme bonding that occurs, enables all future coursework and projects to execute more seamlessly. The team building workshop experience accelerates the natural stages of team performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A creative use of the TEAM workshop is as a leadership observation and selection tool. Applicants undergo an intensive application and interview process, which narrows the candidate pool down to a short list of strong candidates. The finalists participate in the TEAM program and their behaviors are measured against desired leadership traits for their role as leadership coaches.</p>
