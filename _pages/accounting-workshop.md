## Accounting Comes Alive helps participants understand the basis for sound financial decision making, which drives business decisions.

Our proprietary system, Color Accounting uses color, visual and tactile techniques to quickly and easily help participants understand and analyze financial information. This one-day experience uses diagrams and logical colors to show _graphically_ how accounting works and as a result builds a potent model of how business works. In the seminar, participants are presented with real business scenarios, which must be analyzed using standard accounting principles and terminology. 

The result is your employees will use a common language, understand where they fit in, and know-how they impact profitability. In the end... they will make better business decisions.

### In our accounting workshops, every participant will be exposed to key financial concepts:

* A clear appreciation that accounting is fundamental in understanding business
* And therefore how this helps make sound business decisions
* Interpreting balance sheets and income statements
* Profitability and Loss
* Management Ratios
* Standard Financial Reporting
* Business and Financial Communication

### Employees take the lessons from our accounting seminars and, guided by the facilitator, utilize them in interpreting your financials.

* Confidence in reading and interpreting your financial statements
* Use financial analysis to drive your business decision-making
* Justify your business decisions
* Use financials to collaborate with your colleagues and to explain the “why” of your business decisions
