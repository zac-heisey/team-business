## In the corporate, non profit or hospital environment:

In our Accounting Comes Alive accounting seminar, participants are presented with real business scenarios, which must be analyzed using standard accounting principles and terminology. Our unique financial literacy program uses a unique and clever color-coding system, called Color Accounting, which solidifies their understanding.

Color Accounting is a revolutionary new way of quickly and easily understanding financial information in one day. It uses diagrams and logical colors to show graphically how accounting works - it builds a potent model of how business works. The result is your employees will use a common language, understand where they fit in, and know how they impact profitability. In the end... they will make better business decisions.

### In our accounting workshops, every participant will be exposed to key financial concepts:

- A clear appreciation that accounting is fundamental in understanding business
- And therefore how this helps make sound business decisions
- Interpreting balance sheets and income statements
- Profitability and Loss
- Management Ratios
- Standard Financial Reporting
- Business and Financial Communication

### Employees take the lessons from our accounting seminars and, guided by the facilitator, utilize them in interpreting your financials.

- Confidence in reading and interpreting your financial statements
- Use financial analysis to drive your business decision-making
- Justify your business decisions
- Use financials to collaborate with your colleagues and to explain the “why” of your business decisions
