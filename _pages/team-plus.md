CORPORATE PROGRAMSThe TEAM+ Program<span style="color: #ffffff;">The TEAM+ workshop teaches teamwork skills and creates bonds in a group that often last beyond the workshop. In this simulation, business competition among the teams is structured to be particularly intense and dynamic. As the workshop progresses, new business challenges put competitors under extreme time pressure, allowing teams to observe behaviors under stress.</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">Participants learn not only about the importance of teamwork and communication, but also their own strengths and limitations in intense situations. The emotional power of these interactions has a powerful and lasting effect and is for many, a road to increased self awareness and self confidence.</span>BOOK THIS EXPERIENCE
<p style="font-size: 24px;">Participants get a clear view into how they and their peers behave in a “pressure-cooker” environment.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">The TEAM+ simulation quickly breaks down conversational barriers and brings participants together through intensity and fun, helping them learn:</p>

<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A view into their individual behavior under stress</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting insight into the power--or weakness--of collective decision-making</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sound understanding of the decision-making and thinking processes of their team members</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-operation inside and beyond the workshop</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solid overview of the decision making process inside a corporation</span></li>
</ul>
During the simulation employees gain valuable personal leadership and team working lessons, which they can apply when they return to their organization. The TEAM program:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break down functional silos</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage cooperation across departments</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shared language with management to facilitate business-like communications</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team-based approach to solving problems, making decisions and adding value</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to contribute to, and the willingness to embrace change</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shared language with management to facilitate business-like communications</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants will inevitably discover things about their behavior under stress and their innate abilities, all cultivated in a safe and supportive learning environment. Participants will have an intense--yet fun--experience whose impact goes beyond just learning, and into self discovery.</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Teams typically have 4-10 members each, and a workshop can be up to 50 people. Participants of all disciplines can participate. The program can be run in 1 full day or 2 half-day sessions.</p>
