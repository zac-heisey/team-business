OUR BUSINESS IS SEEING YOUR STUDENTS EXCEL<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">ENRICH YOUR CURRICULUM WITH HANDS-ON,
INTERACTIVE, LEARNING EXPERIENCES</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the <strong>BOX entrepreneurship workshop</strong>, students are intensively engaged in starting and running a “start-up” business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This high school business workshop teaches team based, experiential, hands-on business skills, all the while combining competition, negotiation, teamwork and many other essential soft skills that can’t be learned via a textbook or lecture.  When it comes to teaching business in high school, group simulations and experienced based training make the curriculum real! Add this program to an existing course, implement it as a special activity at school, partner with a local business or add it to a summer program.  Half or full day programs available.</p>
