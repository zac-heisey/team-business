### HOSPITALS & HEALTHCARE

Hospitals employ staff that are talented medical professionals – they likely lack business acumen knowledge and experience. With the dramatic changes taking place in the hospital industry, business skills are now a critical factor for a hospital’s profitability and viability. Our business workshops fast track business acumen learning through hands-on, group-based experiences. In one day, medical staff can learn business concepts and begin to deploy them to their individual challenges, as well as those of their hospital. When Team Business workshops are deployed across departments and roles, it results in stronger collaboration, driving better patient care and financial results.

## WHAT CLIENTS SAY

### CORPORATIONS & NON PROFITS

Aluminum Manufacturing Company

CEO

We were a business that was in financial trouble – when we engaged Team Business, there was a strong chance we would go out of business or into Chapter 11. I needed a tool to help my staff think like real business people – understanding the implications of each decision they were making. I needed creative ideas and solutions to be brought to the table - fast. Team Business’ program, BOX+ helped my staff think across the whole business and not just in their functional silos. At a time when my leadership team was under incredible stress, the Team Business folks brought solid business thinking, a tremendous amount of fun and engaged my whole team in becoming a part of the solution.

GlowPoint

Michael Brandofino

Former CEO GlowPoint

I was CTO for a small publicly-traded company that was having difficulty and in 2006 I took over as CEO and had to make drastic changes to stop the bleeding and turn the company around. Interestingly we had invested the prior year in the Team Business Program where we cycled all of our employees through the program.

The BOX+ experience gave the employees an understanding of the challenges and decisions that must be made to drive business and more importantly the ramifications of those decisions. When it came time to right-size the staff, our employees understood that it was to save other jobs and help us focus on fixing the company. We were successful and the company still exists today because the team pulled together and leveraged things they learned in the program.
