### CORPORATIONS & NON PROFITS

Our group workshops and narrative-based exercises help your team fully comprehend what complex set of decisions go into making a business work. We work alongside your team, guiding them through a structured program. Our programs can deliver value as a team-building experience and can rapidly improve the business decisions your teams make – leading to better collaboration and business results. If you offer internship programs, enhance your offerings by giving participants actionable workshops that teach them foundational business principles. These programs enhance their contribution to your business during their internship, as well as reveal important character and behavioural traits.

### HIGH SCHOOLS

Team Business offers team-based, experiential business workshops to public and private high schools. Our workshops give teachers and students a hands-on experience that enriches their education. The experiential and highly interactive nature of our programs provide the added benefit of rapid team bonding and the opportunity to observe personality traits in a safe environment. We are not a replacement for the lessons learned; we augment the classroom with practical and fundamental experience-based examples that help to make the curriculum real.

### HOSPITALS & HEALTHCARE

Hospitals employ staff that are talented medical professionals – they likely lack business acumen knowledge and experience. With the dramatic changes taking place in the hospital industry, business skills are now a critical factor for a hospital’s profitability and viability. Our business workshops fast track business acumen learning through hands-on, group-based experiences. In one day, medical staff can learn business concepts and begin to deploy them to their individual challenges, as well as those of their hospital. When Team Business workshops are deployed across departments and roles, it results in stronger collaboration, driving better patient care and financial results.
