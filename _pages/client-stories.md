  description: Our group workshops and narrative-based exercises help your team fully
    comprehend what complex set of decisions go into making a business work. We work
    alongside your team, guiding them through a structured program. Our programs can
    deliver value as a team-building experience and can rapidly improve the business
    decisions your teams make – leading to better collaboration and business results.
    If you offer internship programs, enhance your offerings by giving participants
    actionable workshops that teach them foundational business principles. These programs
    enhance their contribution to your business during their internship, as well as
    reveal important character and behavioral traits.
  client-stories:
  - byline-1: GlowPoint, $26M in Revenues, 130 employees
    byline-2: From Michael Brandofino, Former CEO GlowPoint
    story: "<blockquote><p>I was CTO for a small publicly-traded company that was
      having difficulty and in 2006 I took over as CEO and had to make drastic changes
      to stop the bleeding and turn the company around. Interestingly we had invested
      the prior year in the Team Business Program where we cycled all of our employees
      through the program. The BOX+ experience gave the employees an understanding
      of the challenges and decisions that must be made to drive business and more
      importantly the ramifications of those decisions. When it came time to right-size
      the staff, our employees understood that it was to save other jobs and help
      us focus on fixing the company. We were successful and the company still exists
      today because the team pulled together and leveraged things they learned in
      the program.</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: Aluminum Manufacturing Company from the CEO
    byline-2: ''
    story: "<blockquote><p>We were a business that was in financial trouble – when
      we engaged Team Business, there was a strong chance we would go out of business
      or into Chapter 11. I needed a tool to help my staff think like real business
      people – understanding the implications of each decision they were making. I
      needed creative ideas and solutions to be brought to the table - fast. Team
      Business’ program, BOX+ helped my staff think across the whole business and
      not just in their functional silos. At a time when my leadership team was under
      incredible stress, the Team Business folks brought solid business thinking,
      a tremendous amount of fun and engaged my whole team in becoming a part of the
      solution.</p></blockquote>"
- title: Hospitals & Healthcare
  description: Hospitals employ staff that are talented medical professionals – they
    likely lack business acumen knowledge and experience. With the dramatic changes
    taking place in the hospital industry, business skills are now a critical factor
    for a hospital’s profitability and viability. Our business workshops fast track
    business acumen learning through hands-on, group-based experiences. In one day,
    medical staff can learn business concepts and begin to deploy them to their individual
    challenges, as well as those of their hospital. When Team Business workshops are
    deployed across departments and roles, it results in stronger collaboration, driving
    better patient care and financial results.
  client-stories:
  - byline-1: "$30B in Revenues, Global Healthcare Solutions Company"
    byline-2: Learning and Development Organization
    story: "<blockquote><p>Team Business was engaged to run the Value Based Management
      (VBM), experiential learning workshop to address the enterprise-wide objective
      of increasing business acumen competency across all staff levels and disciplines.
      Our staff is comprised of talented engineers and technologists. We needed a
      tool to help our specialized practitioners understand the end-to-end business
      impact of the decisions they were making.</p><p></p><p>Historically, our product
      leaders focused on developing innovative, life-saving devices where we surpassed
      quality targets without exception. As we expanded our market reach and moved
      into new products and therapies, our staff struggled to shift their mindset
      to the new products and markets we were serving. In addition, while our focus
      had been so product intensive, we now needed our staff to think more broadly
      to incorporate markets, customer needs and expectations, competition, opportunity
      identification and cross-business unit collaboration.</p><p></p><p>Team Business’
      Value Based Management helped us to shift our mindsets and equipped us to be
      more strategic in how we achieve our multi-level objectives in the one program,
      in just two days. We could bring cross-business unit staff and teams together
      to experience the Value Based Management simulation. The simulation created
      an environment of collaboration, taught solid business acumen and encouraged
      cross-role thinking. Following the simulation, the program then turned the discussion
      to real challenges in our business and the teams worked towards identifying
      ideas and deploying solutions to meet these objectives.</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: Multi-regional hospital, $1.4B in revenues
    byline-2: Learning and Development Organization
    story: "<blockquote><p>I design curriculum for our high potential medical professionals
      and administrators running multi-million dollar business units. These are very
      talented medical professionals with limited business experience – I needed a
      tool to rapidly teach them business. They needed to understand their business
      drivers and constraints and to uncover what to do about them. Team Business
      provided them with business tools and theories to structure their thinking.</p><p></p><p>Our
      high-potential leaders gained perspective on the Classic 10 business theories,
      and directly applied that knowledge in strategic action learning projects that
      benefited our organization. The facilitated discussion of the Team Business
      Classic 10 theories helped the group make strong connections from the practical
      application in the simulation to how our business operates. That segment was
      rated highest out of all the ones we had at the two-day leadership workshop.</p><p></p><p>Both
      André and Lara explain finance, accounting and business management concepts
      eloquently, and with a delightful bit of humor. They make the business theories
      come to life through excellent real-world examples.</p><p></p><p>The Box simulation
      was fun! All the participants had a great time getting to know each other as
      they were “running their businesses.” The simulation had a dual purpose for
      us: it served as a team-building exercise, as well as a way to teach the group
      about financial and business management concepts that can be applied in our
      organization.</p><p></p><p>André meets the participants where they are. We had
      several medical and health care professionals in our group, and they were able
      to understand concepts quickly, so André adjusted the content in the moment
      to reflect the fast pace the participants wanted.</p><p></p><p>It is also so
      easy to work with Lara and André to customize the workshop and materials for
      the needs of our learners.</p></blockquote>"

  description: Team Business offers team-based, experiential business workshops to
    Universities and Colleges. Our workshops give faculty and students a hands-on
    experience that enriches their education. The experiential and highly interactive
    nature of our programs provide the added benefit of rapid team bonding and the
    opportunity to observe personality traits in a safe environment. We are not a
    replacement for the lessons learned; we augment the classroom with practical and
    fundamental experience-based examples that help to make the curriculum real.
  client-stories:
  - byline-1: Wharton Leadership Program
    byline-2: LYNN KRAGE, DIRECTOR, WHARTON EXECUTIVE COACHING AND FEEDBACK PROGRAM,
      WHARTON LEADERSHIP PROGRAM, LECTURER, MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT
    story: "<blockquote><p>I run the Wharton Leadership Fellows Program. Leadership
      Fellows are charged with providing every first-year student with the opportunity
      to enhance their leadership potential through the development of practical tools
      and concrete strategies applicable in every area of their lives. The Leadership
      Fellows act as mentors for the incoming class. It is critical that we recruit
      the best talent to fill this role.</p><p></p><p>We engage in a rigorous application
      and interview process to find the best talent. We brought in Team Business to
      run a program as part of our selection process. I needed a tool to see how our
      candidates behaved in a team and pressure-cooker environment, so I could understand
      their leadership and coaching traits and their temperaments. We have been working
      with Team Business for over 14 years. The energy around teamwork generated by
      the simulation is electric and I believe that the students have a great deal
      of fun while also learning valuable insights about how to work together effectively
      in teams, despite the fact that they are being evaluated. To me, that is the
      unique factor that Team Business brings - the students are so engaged that they
      forget they are being evaluated!</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: University of Pennsylvania
    byline-2: JAIME L. DAVIS, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR – THE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUMMER
      INSTITUTE THE JEROME FISHER PROGRAM IN MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
    story: "<blockquote><p>I manage the Management and Technology Summer Institute
      (M&amp;TSI). M&amp;TSI is an extremely rigorous, non-stop, fast-paced college
      course for 60 high school students. The program introduces students to the fundamental
      knowledge and skills necessary for successfully linking technology and management
      concepts in just three weeks.</p><p></p><p>Since the program is only three weeks,
      we needed a tool to help the students bond fast so the rest of the program is
      more effective and productive. Another objective is for them to learn about
      leadership and business in an experiential and hands-on, interactive way. We
      have been working with Team Business for over 14 years. Their simulation is
      an integral part of our program because the students always enjoy it and remark
      that is a highlight to not only the beginning of the course but also a healthy
      introduction to working together in groups. Teamwork is a big part of M&amp;TSI,
      not to mention their final grade, and the Team Business simulation helps our
      students get to where they need to be, in the shortest amount of time possible.
      Plus, working with Lara and André is a delight!</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: Tuck Business School
    byline-2: DIA DRAPER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
    story: "<blockquote><p>Team Business and the LEAD program at Tuck Business School
      worked together for over 5 years. Team Business’ involvement in getting our
      students the basics of accounting and entrepreneurship has been a game-changer
      for our elite program and what our students take-away with them in terms of
      business nomenclature and exposure to financial accounting concepts and running
      a business. Our students use the learning from Accounting Comes Alive and The
      BOX Game to aid them in their capstone project, at the end of their 3-week program
      each group of 5 must professionally present or “pitch” an original business
      idea to a “board” and a winner is chosen based on their presentation, financials
      and feasibility of the enterprise.</p><p></p><p>Lara and André are easy colleagues
      and the students totally dig André’s style and he can connect with that young
      adult demographic in a way that few people can. Their international experience
      and cross-cultural exposure allow them to be “real” with our students, the majority
      of whom are African American, Native American and Latino American high school
      students. There’s nothing we’ve asked that they haven’t done for us including
      being our go-to 4th and 5th of July academic programming. Most importantly,
      their sincere affection for our students is what seals the deal for me.</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: Denison University's Organizational Studies Program
    byline-2: DAVID PRZYBYLA, PH.D., DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
    story: "<blockquote><p>The program includes a four-week summer session designed
      to help students appreciate the many applications of their liberal arts education
      to real-world work settings and challenges. For the past several years, the
      talented people of Team Business have used creative and highly engaging simulations
      to help our students understand the strategic thinking necessary for managing
      a business from its inception through divestment.</p><p></p><p>In the process,
      students test and develop their skills in negotiation, leadership, and teamwork,
      and come to appreciate more fully the roles of individuals and teams in effective
      organizational functioning. The success of Team Business simulations is due
      in no small part to the wit and wisdom of facilitator Andre van der Bergh. He
      develops a rapport with students that promotes extensive interaction and active
      learning. Student evaluations of Andre and his work fall somewhere between awesome
      and mind-blowing.</p></blockquote>"

      B. WENTZ AND HOWARD B. WENTZ JR. TEACHING CHAIR IN INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES
    story: "<blockquote><p>Kent’s SEEK summer program consists of engineering and
      entrepreneurship programs for high schools students. We needed a tool to give
      our students a good understanding of the fundamentals of business, as they work
      toward developing a new product idea and presenting how they plan to go to market.
      The Team Business workshop promotes teamwork and our students find it captivating.
      It is an enjoyable and useful tool.</p></blockquote>"
  - byline-1: The Harker School, Private High School in Silicon Valley
    byline-2: JUSTON GLASS, MS, CPA, DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAMS,
      BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP (BE) DEPARTMENT
    story: "<blockquote><p>Along with teaching principles of business, I also direct
      our business and entrepreneurship programs at The Harker School. In the summer,
      I offer a multi-week summer intensive program, where students innovate a new
      product or service and then develop a “pitch presentation” to a panel of investors.
      I include Team Business programs so that I integrate hands-on, learn by doing
      instruction in my curriculum. I have found that students best learn beyond just
      through lectures – having something dynamic and exciting to keep them engaged
      and energetic is what makes the best experience possible!</p><p></p><p>I engage
      Team Business because their programs teach great lessons first hand about business,
      all the while combining competition, negotiation, teamwork and many other essential
      soft skills that can’t be learned in a textbook. Team Business is a great team
      to work with, can customize to your specific dynamics, are very responsive,
      and their facilitators (André and Lara) really help make the group experience
      one to remember! I highly recommend Team Business for any of your business educational
      and/or team building needs!</p></blockquote>"
