<p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>TEAM + team effectiveness</strong> <strong>workshop</strong> is a full or half day group simulation designed to expose participants to how team dynamics in the workplace strongly impact business relationships and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the team-effectiveness workshop, employees gain valuable team building training and learn about  personal leadership and team dynamics in the workplace, which they can apply when they return to their organization.  More than team building - realign members to the company goals.
