TEACH TEAMWORK THROUGH FAST PACED, DYNAMIC COMPETITION<span style="color: #000; font-size: 45px;">LEADERSHIP, TEAMWORK, STRATEGY AND EXECUTION</span>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>TEAM workshop</strong> consists of team building activities for high school students. This highly effective workshop teaches teamwork skills and creates bonds in a group that last beyond the workshop.  Students learn not only about the importance of teamwork and communication, but also their own strengths and limitations in intense situations. The emotional power of these interactions has a powerful and lasting effect and is for many, a road to increased self-awareness and self- confidence. Teach team interdependence through fast paced, dynamic competition.  Group simulations and experienced based training makes the curriculum real!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Add this program to an existing course, implement it as a special activity at school, partner with a local business or add it to a summer program.  Half or full day programs available.</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">An incredible bond is established as the teams work towards a common goal to achieve success</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">A view into the student's individual behavior under stress</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Interesting insight into the power or weakness of collective decision making</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">A sound understanding of the decision making and thinking processes of their team members</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">The experience breaks down barriers and encourages cooperation beyond the workshop</li>
</ul>
